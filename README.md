# JS Object Modeling

## Objectives

- Practice with functions, arrays, and objects.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Create and checkout to a new branch, named `homework`.
1. When finished, add, commit and push to your fork to submit a pull request.

## Activity

- Create a file named `mbta.js` to calculate the number of stops between
  stations on the "MBTA". Write additional functions used by this function as
  needed.
- The function takes the line and stop that a rider is getting on at and the
  line and stop that a rider is getting off at and **returns the total number of
  stops for the trip**.

There are 3 subway lines:

- Red
  - South Station
  - Park Street
  - Kendall
  - Central
  - Harvard
  - Porter
  - Davis
  - Alewife
- Green 
  - Government Center
  - Park Street
  - Boylston
  - Arlington
  - Copley
  - Hynes
  - Kenmore
- Orange 
  - North Station
  - Haymarket
  - Park Street
  - State
  - Downtown Crossing
  - Chinatown
  - Back Bay
  - Forest Hills
- All 3 subway lines intersect at *Park Street*, but there are no other intersection points. 

The function will be invoked using the following pattern of arguments:

`Start Line`, `Start Station`, `End Line`, `End Station`

Here are some examples of how should be invoked.

```js
stopsBetweenStations('Red', 'Alewife', 'Red', 'Alewife') // 0 stops
stopsBetweenStations('Red', 'Alewife', 'Red', 'South Station') // 7 stops
stopsBetweenStations('Red', 'South Station', 'Green', 'Kenmore') // 6 stops
```
```
const stopsBtweenStations = function (startLine, startStation, endLine, endStation){

		const subwayLines = {
			red:["South Station", "Park Street", "Kendall", "Central", "Harvard", "Porter", "Davis", "Alewife"],
      green:["Government Center", "Park Street", "Boylston", "Arlington", "Copley", "Hynes", "Kenmore"],
			Orange:["North Stationr", "Haymarket", "Park Street","State", "Downtown Crossing", "Chinatown", "BackBay", "Forest Hills"]};
		};
        totalStops=0;








        return totalStops;

}

```
## Hints

- Consider diagramming the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their
  stops and intersection.
- Solve an easier problem first like only traveling on the Red line.
- Assume good input.  Your function does not need to check the validity of the line or
  stop.
- Subway lines are keys in a dictionary (object literal), while the values are
  a list (array) of all the stops on each line.
- The key to the practice is to find the **intersection** of the lines at
  *Park Street*.


## Bonus (Optional)

- Add validation so that the function only accepts Red, Green, and Orange for lines and only accepts the correct stops for each of their stops.
- Have the function print the line and stops as they ride the train.
- Example:
```js
stopsBetweenStations('Red', 'South Station', 'Green', 'Copley') 

// Rider boards the train a Red Line and South Station.
// Rider arrives at Red Line and Park Street.
// Rider transfers from Red Line to Green Line at Park Street.
// Rider arrives at Green Line and Boylston.
// Rider arrives at Green Line and Arlington.
// Rider arrives at Green Line and Copley.
// Rider exits the train at Green Line and Copley.
```

## Bonus (Super Optional)

If you have made it this far and are still looking for a challenge. Then take a stab at the [MTA Puzzle](https://github.com/sei-relativity/hw-w01d05-js-mta-optional) and see how far you can push yourself.
